## Illustration of kafka-elasticsearch-standalone-consumer usage

### The consumer is positioned in the middle.

# Introduction

### **Kafka Standalone Consumer will read the messages from Kafka, processes and index them in ElasticSearch.**

### **Easily Scaleable & Extendable !**

### _As described in the illustration above, here is how the StandAlone Consumer works:_

* Kafka has a topic named, say `Topic_1`

* Lets say, `Topic_1` has 5 partitions.

* Now, there is a needed to read, process the messages from Kafka and ElasticSearch

* In order to do that, have 5 Config Files and start 5 instances of this Standalone Consumer by tying each config file to the respective Consumer Instance.

* Now, we will have 5 Consumer Standalone Daemons running, listening & processing messages from each partition of `Topic_1` in Kafka.

* When there is a new partitions(say `6th partition`) in the same `Topic_1`, then start a new Consumer Daemon instance pointing to the new partition(`i.e: 6th partition`)

* This way, there is a clear way of subscribing and processing messages from multiple partitions across multiple topics using this Stand alone Consumer.

# How to use ? 

### Method 1: running as a standard Jar 

**1. Download the code into a `$CONSUMER_HOME` dir.

**2. create your own copy of the `$CONSUMER_HOME`/src/main/resources/kafkaESConsumer.properties file - update all relevant properties as explained in the comments

**3. update `$CONSUMER_HOME`/src/main/resources/logback.xml - specify directory you want to store logs in:
	<property name="LOG_DIR" value="/tmp"/>

**4. build/create the app jar:
		cd $CONSUMER_HOME
     	mvn clean package
	The kafka-es-consumer-0.2.jar will be created in the $CONSUMER_HOME/bin

**5. run the app [use JDK1.8] :  
		cd $CONSUMER_HOME/bin
		java -jar kafka-es-consumer-0.2.jar <absolutePathToConsumerPropertiesFile>

 

### Method 2: running via JSVC as a Daemon

**1. Download the code. Let's say, `$CONSUMER_HOME` contains the code.**

**2. From the `$CONSUMER_HOME`, build the maven project.** - _this step will create the JAR file with all Consumer dependencies inside

    mvn clean package

**3. Create a config file for the Consumer Instance and provide all necessary properties.** - _Use the existing Config file `$CONSUMER_HOME`/src/main/resources/kafkaESConsumer.properties` as template._

    cp $CONSUMER_HOME/src/main/resources/kafkaESConsumer.properties $CONSUMER_HOME/config/<consumerGroupName><topicName><PartitionNum>.properties

    vi $CONSUMER_HOME/src/main/resources/<consumerGroupName><topicName><PartitionNum>.properties - Edit & provide the correct config details.


_These files will be copied into the $CONSUMER_HOME/bin/classes/ dir after the build._
_The details & guide for each property in the config file is given in the property file itself._


**4. Start the Consumer as follows:**


    cd $CONSUMER_HOME/scripts
    
    vi consumerNew.sh
    
    Provide the value for all the below variables:
    
    # Setup variables
    #Set the full path of top directory of this kafka consumer
    base_dir=
    JAVA_HOME=
    #User as which the Consumer Daemon has to be run
    USER=

    ./consumerNew.sh -p start -c $CONSUMER_HOME/config/<consumerGroupName><topicName><PartitionNum>.properties

    # ' -p ' - Can take either start | stop | restart
    
    # ' -c ' - the config file for the consumer instance with path 
    # (e.g: '$CONSUMER_HOME/config/<consumerGroupName><topicName><PartitionNum>.properties')

**5. Confirm the successful start of the Consumer by looking into:**

_The below log file contains INFO during starting, restarting & stopping the Consumer Instance._

    #'$consumerGroupName,$topic,$partition' - properties as defined in the consumer instances's config file (i.e: '<consumerGroupName><topicName><PartitionNum>.properties' in this example
    
    vi $CONSUMER_HOME/processLogs/<$consumerGroupName>_<$topic>_<$partition>.out

_The below log file contains ERROR during starting, restarting & stopping the Consumer Instance._

    #'$consumerGroupName,$topic,$partition' - properties as defined in the consumer instances's config file (i.e: '<consumerGroupName><topicName><PartitionNum>.properties' in this example

    vi $CONSUMER_HOME/processLogs/<$consumerGroupName>_<$topic>_<$partition>.err

**6. Monitor the processing in the log file defined by the following property in the Consumer's Respective Config file.**


**7. To Stop the Consumer Instance:**

    cd $CONSUMER_HOME/scripts

    ./consumerNew.sh -p stop -c $CONSUMER_HOME/config/<consumerGroupName><topicName><PartitionNum>.properties

**8. To Restart the Consumer Instance:**

    cd $CONSUMER_HOME/scripts

    ./consumerNew.sh -p restart -c $CONSUMER_HOME/config/<consumerGroupName><topicName><PartitionNum>.properties

# Versions:

### Kafka Version: 0.8.2.1

### ElasticSearch: > 1.5.1

### Scala Version for Kafka Build: 2.10.0

# Configuring the Consumer Instance:

The details of each config property can be seen in the template file (below)

# Message Handler Class

*  `org.elasticsearch.kafka.consumer.MessageHandler` is an Abstract class that has most of the functionality of reading data from Kafka and batch-indexing into ElasticSearch already implemented. It has one abstract method, `transformMessage()`, that can be overwritten in the concrete sub-classes to customize message transformation before posting into ES

* `org.elasticsearch.kafka.consumer.messageHandlers.RawMessageStringHandler` is a simple concrete sub-class of the MessageHAndler that sends messages into ES with no additional transformation, as is, in the 'UTF-8' format

* Usually, its effective to Index the message in JSON format in ElasticSearch. This can be done using a Mapper Class and transforming the message from Kafka by overriding/implementing the `transformMessage()` method. An example can be found here: `org.elasticsearch.kafka.consumer.messageHandlers.AccessLogMessageHandler`

* _**Do remember to set the newly created message handler class in the `messageHandlerClass` config property of the consumer instance.**_

# IndexHandler Interface and basic implementation

*  `org.elasticsearch.kafka.consumer.IndexHandler` is an interface that defines two methods: getIndexName(params) and getIndexType(params). 

* `org.elasticsearch.kafka.consumer.BasicIndexHandler` is a simple imlementation of this interface that returnes indexName and indexType values as configured in the kafkaESConsumer.properties file. 

* one might want to create a custom implementation of IndexHandler if, for example, index name and type are not static for all incoming messages but depend on the event data - for example customerId, orderId, etc. In that case, pass all info that is required to perform that custom index determination logic as a Map of parameters into the getIndexName(params) and getIndexType(params) methods (or pass NULL if no such data is required)

* _**Do remember to set the index handler class in the `indexHandlerClass` property in the kafkaESConsumer.properties file. By default, BasicIndexHandler is used**_
